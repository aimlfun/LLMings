This application requires .net9 and Visual Studio 2022 (Community works).

Download https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
Download the source-code as a ZIP.
Save it where you like - I tend to use c:\repos\ai{folder-name}, feel free to choose a better folder.
Open the solution, and enjoy!
Any problems? Post a comment on my blog, and I will happily try to assist.
